# Climate-change-predictor-using-ML-techniques
A project for prediction of Global Warming Parameters such as increase in temperature and green house gases concentration's in order to control and manage climate change .We have used ML algorithm's such as linear regression Support Vector Machines and DL algorithms RNN and LSTM .
# How-to-use-and-leverage-the-project
To use the project, one need's to access the Jupyter Notebooks included in the project files. These notebooks contain the code and models necessary for making predictions, specifically utilizing LSTM, RNN, linear regression, and support vector machines.You can enter your data(Basically the future or past date on which you want your gas/temperature value) and get the prediction.
