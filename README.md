# Climate change predictor usig ML & DL techniques
This project focuses on the prediction of key global warming indicators—such as the rise in global temperature and the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases like CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O—in an effort to support climate change management and mitigation.
We employ a combination of Machine Learning algorithms, including Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), along with advanced Deep Learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). These models are particularly suited for analyzing and forecasting temporal patterns in environmental data.
# How to use and leverage the project
Accurately predicting future temperature rise and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations is critical in the global response to climate change. This project leverages powerful machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast trends in key GHGs like CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, as well as temperature shifts driven by their accumulation.
Such predictive modeling plays a vital role in understanding the pace of environmental change, enabling better-informed decisions on mitigation and adaptation strategies. By providing data-driven insights, this project supports scientists, policymakers, and climate advocates in planning for a more sustainable future..
# Importance
To use the project, users need to access the Jupyter Notebooks included in the project files. These notebooks contain the code and models necessary for making predictions, specifically utilizing LSTM, RNN, linear regression, and support vector machines.
