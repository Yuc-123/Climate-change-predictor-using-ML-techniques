# Climate-change-predictor-using-ML-techniques
A project for prediction of Global Warming Parameters such as increase in temperature and green house gases concentration's in order to control and manage climate change .We have used ML algorithm's such as linear regression Support Vector Machines and DL algorithms RNN and LSTM .
